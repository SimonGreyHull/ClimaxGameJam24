## Inspirations

Have enjoyed playing vampire survivors recently. Mechanics are fairly simple - would like to allow the player a little more control, and probably have fewer enemies with more complex behaviours.

Really like the idea of a challenging task that allows you to upgrade skills between play sessions.

Also enjoyed Doom Eternal, in particular the way enemies are more accurate when the player stops moving.

Also like the idea of allowing for more stealthy paths (like in Dishonoured).

# Theme
